# ExcitesandBitesApp
Excites and bites is a application that is useful for finding events and places that sell food in any location you may end up traveling to.  This app works by using html, css, and javascript.  The page layout and styling is all done by using html and css.  The functionality of the page works by using an API to find events and food places.  Google maps is used to figure out what food places are in a certain range of the event you wish to attend so you can plan your whole day out in advance.

To see an example of the page here is the link to the live site https://excitesandbites.herokuapp.com/ the search form does not work due to problems with the API that needs to be fixed.
